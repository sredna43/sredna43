Hello folks, my name is Anders and you've been ill-fated enough to stumble across my personal github repository. 
I do hope you enjoy your visit, and don't mind all the half-finished projects... I'll get around to those... eventually.

<!---
sredna43/sredna43 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
